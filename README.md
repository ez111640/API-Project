This project was created for week 16 of the full time online App Academy program.

For this program, we built off of our backend project from three weeks ago, adding the new technologies we learned over the past few weeks. The purpose of this part of the project was to complete the frontend, using JSX and redux.

For this project, I used JSX, redux, react, sequelize, express, and SQL.


In order to launch the project locally, you must download or clone all related files, including the favicon. Open the project folder using a text editor such as VS Code. Navigate into the backend and frontend folders in your terminal, and open both using 'npm start'.
